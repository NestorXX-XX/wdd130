        <p>Hi, my name is Nestor, and I’d like to welcome you to my WDD 130 class page! Here, you’ll be able to explore
            all of the
            projects, assignments, and activities I’ve worked on throughout the course. This space is designed to
            showcase my
            progress as I learn the fundamentals of web design and development. Feel free to look around</p>
