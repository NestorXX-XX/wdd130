            <p>Hi, my name is Nestor, and I‚Äôd like to welcome you to my WDD 130 class page! This site is a showcase of
                the
                projects,
                assignments, and activities I will complete throughout the course as I learn the fundamentals of web
                design
                and
                development. From writing HTML and styling with CSS to exploring layout techniques and building
                responsive
                pages, each
                project represents a step forward in my journey. This page is more than just a collection of schoolwork.
                It
                is a
                reflection of the skills I am developing and the creativity I am beginning to apply in web development.
                Feel
                free to
                explore and see what I have been working on. As you browse through this site, you will get a glimpse of
                the
                concepts I
                have been studying and how I have put them into practice. Each section is designed to highlight not only
                what I have
                learned but also how I have grown as a developer, both technically and creatively. Whether you are a
                fellow
                student,
                instructor, or just a curious visitor, I hope you enjoy seeing how my skills have evolved over time.
                Thank
                you for
                stopping by, and I invite you to check back often as I continue to build and improve my work.</p>
